# Exercise
## Create a login app that saves even when the app is closed 
Create an app that will give a user an option to login or register to the app. After logging in or registering there should be a welcome message and all the user info printed on the screen.
* The app user has: Id, Username, Password, Age and Role
* Users need to be saved in a txt document when they register
* There needs to be a log text file that logs the time and username of every user that logs in ( this includes the first time the person is registered and he gets the welcome screen )

## Bonus
* Implement a Change Password option when the user is logged in
* The option will change and save the new password to that person
* The password can't be the same as the previous one
